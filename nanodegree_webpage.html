			<h2>Lesson 1 Notes</h2>
			<!-- I also put each of my concepts in a div box. -->
			<div class="Notes">
				<!-- b and /b are your bold tags, they make any text within them bold -->
				<!-- The p and /p tags break up text into paragraphs and makes thing looks more organized. this tag is also known as a block element, a subject which I will go into detail about later. -->
				<!-- The em and /em tags make any text within the tags italicized. --> 
				<!-- the br tag is the line break that makes your text that follows it start on the next line. The br tag is an example of a void tag, which I will further delve into later. --> 
				<!-- The a href is an anchor tag that makes links to other pages within your web page or to another page on the Internet. -->
				<h3>What is the web, and what makes up the web?</h3>	
				<p>
				The web is a huge network of computers, that all share information with each other. Anything can exist on the web, including<em> videos, images, HTML, and Hyper-links</em>.<b>Hyper-Links</b> are links between web pages, such as <a href="https://www.google.com"> this one</a> that links to Google.com. 
				<br>
				There are four major parts of the web, which are computers, the Internet, servers, and the Internet browser. <b>Computers</b> are machines which run your <b>web browser</b>, that connects to and displays files from the <b>Internet</b>. Which is a huge network of <b>servers</b> also known as huge computers that hold gigabytes of data, and is always on and running.<br><em>HTTP</em> is the protocol that is used to link and communicate with servers.
				</p>

				<!-- First concept ended here so I closed that div/box and started a new one. -->

				<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
				<p>
					<b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hypertext Mark-up Language </em>. HTML is the code that most if not every page on the Internet is written in. HTML is made up of text content, which is what you see on a web page, mark up, which is what defines how your content is laid out, and references or links to other documents.
					<br> 
					<em>HTML Mark up</em>, is made up of <b>elements</b>, and <b>tags</b>   
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Notes">
				<h3>What are Elements and Tags </h3>
				<p>
					<b>Elements</b> are the format in which HTML code is written. An element contains the following an opening tag, the contents of the tag, and the closing tag.
					<br>
					Elements also come in two different forms<em>In-line elements, and Block elements.</em>The difference between the two, is that block elements put a invisible box around the text, whereas in-line elements do not do this.
					<br> 
					<b>Tags</b> are the commands used to format a page, they are usually contained within angled brackets. There are 2 types of tags the first type is a tag that has an opening and closing tag, and there is another type of tag called a <em>void tag</em>. They are tags that only have an opening tag such as the break tag. whereas the paragraph tag would be a normal tag. 
				</p>

				<h3>Computers are stupid? </h3>
				<!-- The span tag can be used to define many things for a certain part of text that you would want to style or change. -->
				<p>
					I personally do not think computers in general are stupid, but they are in one way. <b>Computers take <span style="font-style: italic; color: cyan;">EVERYTHING</span> literally!!!</b> As a result when a programmer writes code they have to be careful, because the computer will interpret everything even mistakes as if it is a command.So be careful when programming and always double check your work.
				</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="Notes">
				<h3>Remember that you can't remember everything.</h3>
				<p>
					The one thing you should remember as a programmer is that you cant remember every command for every language you encounter. <b>But</b> that is why there is this wonderful source called <a href="https://www.google.com">Google.com</a>, that is there to help you if you ever can't remember that certain command that you need.

				<h3>Browser developer tools</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Every</b> browser that you encounter will most likely contain some sort of way for developers to see the code is behind the web page that is being displayed. If you use chrome like I do then all you have to do is hit your F12 key on your keyboard. This will bring up the Developer Console, which will allow you to see the code that is behind the page your on, it will also show you this in a tree like structure with arrows that show and hide different parts of the page. I will talk about this more in another part of this lesson's notes

				<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
				<p>
					CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em>, and it is a styling language. It is used for defining the look and feel of an HTML page, and it does this by using syntax tools. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Notes">	
				<h3>What is a DOM?</h3>
				<p>
					DOM stands for <em>Document Object Model</em>. It is basically the tree structure which I was talking about earlier. It represents they way your HTML code is organized, and how your code is represented in the developer console. If your code is organized then your code should be very easy to read and understand. Examples of this may be the div tag which puts a box around each part of your code that you want to keep organized. Each of these boxes are labeled with a class tag within each div element.   
				</p>

				<h3>Programmers HTML Text Editor</h3>
				<p>
					When making a word document usually you will use a proper text editor such as Microsoft Word or my favorite <a href="https://www.drive.google.com">Google Docs</a>. When making a Text document you don't use Spreadsheet, or Adobe Photo shop do you? Well the same goes for when you are making an HTML document. So most people use programs like sublime, or bluefish, etc to make their HTML documents. That and it's a lot easier to use a dedicated HTML editor, because most include features, such as automatically inserting tags as you type them, and making tags and links different colors so they are easier to find, and also some layout your code in a tree like the Developer console will. So yeah even though you can use a plain text editor to make HTML files, who would want to, when using a different program is a lot easier.

			<h2>Lesson 3 Notes</h2>
			<div class="notes">
				<h3>How is style defined in a web page?</h3>
				<p>
					The style of a web page can be defined in 2 ways. one way it can be defined is within the HTML document like it usually is, but there is another way of defining the style in a web page, and that is by using a<b> CSS style sheet</b>. 
					<br>
					The main reason that you would want to define your style using <b>CSS</b> is to avoid repeating the same code over and over again. It is also known as a search and replace tool, because in CSS you identify a class or tag, and then you define properties like color, or font, or size, or many other properties to change, and then that style is applied to all of the content contained within that class or tag. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="notes">
				<h3>Order matters too</h3>
				<p>
					Cascading is how styles are applied. The place where your rule also matters as well. The further down the chain your rule is, is the more likely it is to override the rules that are above it. This order is shown in green below.
					<br>
					<div class="rule">
						The default style of a browser
						<br>
						Style sheeting in a separate CSS file
						<br> 
						Style sheet inside of the HTML
						<br>
						In-line styles in an element 
					</div> 
			</div>
			<div class="notes">
				<h3>How styling in CSS works.</h3>
				<p>
					With CSS you define a class or HTML element within your HTML file and you add it to your CSS document. Next you make a link to that CSS file in the head of your document using the link rel="stylesheet"href="the name of your css file". Then you define the changes to the font, color, border, spacing, size, you name it, and you can probably change it.within your CSS document. Once that is done, thats it. Any content contained within that class or element will be formatted in the way that you defined, this saves a lot of work when it comes to defining the style of multiple elements.

			</div>
			<div class="notes">
				<h3>Using semantic tags </h3>
				<p>
					Semantic tags are also known as heading tags, they come in many different sizes like h1, h2, h3,ect. Using these tags is the equivalent of setting the heading in a word document, it makes the the document easier to read, because your most import things like headings are bigger, and the less important information like the paragraphs are smaller.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="notes">
				<h3>The box model</h3>
				<p>
				The box model is made up of 4 parts. the margins, borders, padding, and the content. Here is what each of these 4 parts do 
				<br>
					<div class="rule">
						Content- The text or image that is being displayed, it is the center of the box model 
						<br>
						Padding- Clears an area around the the content, also takes the background color of the box.
						<br> 
						Border- Goes around the other two parts of the box, it takes the color and propertied of the box.
						<br>
						Margin- Clears an area around the Border, has no color, and is the space between one box in relation to another.
					</div> 
					<br>
					There are two ways to size a box. one way is to set the size in percents instead of pixels. the other way is to get the box sizing and attribute to the border of the box. 
			</div>
			<div class="notes">
				<h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3>
				<p>
					These are the steps that a web developer takes to make a web page look the way they want it to.
					<br>
						<div class="rule">
							Look for natural boxes 
							<br>
							Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
							<br> 
							Write Your HTML
							<br>
						 	Apply styles biggest to smallest 
							<br>
							Fix Things
